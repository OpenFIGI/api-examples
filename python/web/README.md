# OpenFIGI Web Example

This small web application demonstrates how to make search and mapping requests
to the OpenFIGI API from a browser. It uses only python's built in modules so no
additional packages are required.

## Instructions

Prerequisites: `python3.12` must be installed.

```bash
# Optional: export your API key
export OPENFIGI_API_KEY=<YOUR_KEY_HERE>

python3.12 server.py
```

Then open <http://localhost:3000/> in your browser.
