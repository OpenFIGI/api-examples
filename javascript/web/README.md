# OpenFIGI Web Example

This small web application demonstrates how to make search and mapping requests
to the OpenFIGI API from a browser. It uses only Node's built in modules so no
additional packages are required.

## Instructions

Prerequisites: `node` must be installed.

```bash
# Optional: export your API key
export OPENFIGI_API_KEY=<YOUR_KEY_HERE>

node server.mjs
```

Then open <http://localhost:3000/> in your browser.
